Taarzan The Wonder Car is not just a movie, but also a trivia treasure. There are many interesting facts and stories behind the making of this film that you might not know. Here are some of them:

- The car used in the film was designed by Dilip Chhabria, a famous car designer who has worked with celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Sanjay Dutt. The car was named Taarzan after the legendary character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The car had a logo of DC, which stood for both Dilip Chhabria and Deven Chaudhary, the name of Ajay Devgn's character in the film[^1^].
- The film was inspired by two Hollywood films: Christine (1983), a horror film about a possessed car that kills people, and Herbie (1968), a comedy film about a sentient car that helps its owner. The film was also influenced by a Marathi film called Ek Gadi Baki Anadi (1989), which starred Laxmikant Berde and Ashok Saraf as two friends who inherit a car that can talk and sing[^1^].
- The film marked the debut of two young actors: Vatsal Sheth and Ayesha Takia. Vatsal Sheth played Raj, the son of Deven Chaudhary who inherits Taarzan. Ayesha Takia played Priya, Raj's love interest and the daughter of a car dealer. Both actors went on to star in several films and TV shows after Taarzan The Wonder Car[^1^].
- The film also featured some veteran actors in supporting roles, such as Farida Jalal, Amrish Puri, Gulshan Grover and Sadashiv Amrapurkar. This was one of the last films where Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a negative role. He was known for his villainous roles in films like Ardh Satya (1983), Sadak (1991) and Ishq (1997). He passed away in 2014 due to lung infection[^1^].
- The film was expected to be a big hit at the box office, especially because of the novelty of the car and the star cast. However, the film failed to impress the critics and the audience and flopped miserably. The film was also not released theatrically in some countries like Canada[^1^]. The film has since gained a cult following among some fans who enjoy its cheesy humor and action scenes.
