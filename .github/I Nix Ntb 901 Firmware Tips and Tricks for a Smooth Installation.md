1. Download the latest firmware file for your tablet from a reliable source. You can try searching for "I Nix Ntb 901 Firmware" on the web and look for the file that matches your chip type and board version. For example, if you have an A13 chip and a F900H mainboard V3.0.0, you can download the file sun5i-android-f900-sin-V0.2.3 from 4shared[^1^] or L91\_Android\_4.0.4\_TecSync\_20131019 from pan.baidu[^2^]. Make sure you take your own responsibility for downloading and using the firmware file.
2. Extract the firmware file to a folder on your computer. You should see a file with a .img extension, such as sun5i\_android\_f900\_sin.img or L91\_Android\_4.0.4\_TecSync\_20131019.img.
3. Connect your tablet to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure your tablet is turned off and has enough battery power.
4. Install and run a flashing tool on your computer, such as PhoenixSuit or LiveSuit. You can download these tools from the internet or use the ones that came with your firmware file.
5. Select the firmware file (.img) that you extracted in step 2 and click on the "Upgrade" or "Flash" button on the flashing tool.
6. Follow the instructions on the flashing tool to put your tablet into upgrade mode. This may involve pressing and holding certain buttons on your tablet, such as power and volume, while connecting it to your computer.
7. Wait for the flashing process to complete. Do not disconnect or turn off your tablet or computer during this process.
8. When the flashing is done, disconnect your tablet from your computer and reboot it. You should see a new firmware version on your tablet settings.
