# How SIMARIS design can help you plan electrical networks efficiently and reliably
 
SIMARIS design is a software tool that facilitates electrical network planning on the basis of real products with minimum input â from the medium-voltage down to the socket outlet[^1^]. It is developed by Siemens, a global leader in energy and automation solutions.
 
SIMARIS design allows you to dimension a system solution that meets the requirements of the specific electric power distribution system, such as load flow, short-circuit current, voltage drop, energy balance and more[^1^]. It also ensures that the system solution is in compliance with all the relevant standards (VDE, IEC) and reflects the present state of the art[^1^]. You can also generate comprehensive documentation and reports for the planned network with SIMARIS design[^1^].

SIMARIS design is part of the SIMARIS Suite, which also includes SIMARIS project (for project management), SIMARIS curves (for displaying tripping characteristics) and SIMARIS sketch (for creating single-line diagrams)[^2^]. You can download the SIMARIS Suite free of charge from the Siemens website[^1^] [^2^].
 
If you are looking for a professional and reliable software tool for electrical network planning, you should consider SIMARIS design. It will help you save time and money, ensure quality and safety, and optimize your network performance.

One of the main advantages of SIMARIS design is that it allows you to plan electrical networks based on real products from Siemens. This means that you can select the most suitable components for your network, such as transformers, switchgear, cables, busbars, protection devices and more. You can also compare different products and configurations to find the optimal solution for your network. SIMARIS design also provides you with detailed information about the products, such as technical specifications, prices, availability and delivery times.
 
Another benefit of SIMARIS design is that it supports you in planning electrical networks according to the principles of BIM (Building Information Modeling). BIM is a digital method of designing, constructing and operating buildings and infrastructure that enables collaboration and coordination among all stakeholders. SIMARIS design allows you to create and export BIM-compatible data and models of your electrical network, such as 3D geometry, parameters, attributes and connections. You can also import BIM data from other software tools, such as Autodesk Revit or AutoCAD. This way, you can ensure consistency and interoperability throughout the entire planning process.
 
A third advantage of SIMARIS design is that it offers you a user-friendly and intuitive interface that guides you through the planning process. You can easily enter the input data for your network, such as load profiles, topology, voltage levels and more. You can also use predefined templates and wizards to simplify your work. SIMARIS design also provides you with graphical and numerical feedback on your network performance, such as voltage distribution, power flow, losses and more. You can also visualize your network in different views, such as single-line diagrams, 3D models or geographic maps.
