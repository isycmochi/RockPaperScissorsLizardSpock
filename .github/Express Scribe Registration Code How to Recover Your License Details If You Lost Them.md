If you want to use Express Scribe beyond the trial period, you need to purchase a license and register the software. This will unlock all the features and remove any limitations or reminders. In this article, we will show you how to register Express Scribe Transcription Software in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Purchase a license
 
You can purchase a license for Express Scribe online at the [Purchase Software webpage](https://www.nch.com.au/scribe/purchase.html). You can choose between a single user license or a site license, depending on your needs. You can also select different license classes, such as Standard, Professional or Enterprise.
 
After buying the software, you will receive a registration code on the screen and by email. This code is required to activate the software. If you purchased multiple software products, you will receive a 13-digit serial number instead. This number must be activated online at [https://secure.nch.com.au/activate](https://secure.nch.com.au/activate) by filling out the form and activating the software. After this is complete, you will receive a registration code on the screen and by email.
 
## Step 2: Enter the registration code
 
Once you have your registration code, you need to enter it into the registration window in the software. To do this, follow these steps:
 
- Open Express Scribe on your computer.
- Click Product name on the menu bar and select Register Product name... to open the Register dialog.
- Enter your software registration code into the Register Dialog using copy and paste. You can copy the code from the purchase confirmation webpage or from your registration email.
- Click Register to complete the process.

If you do not receive an error message, the registration code has been accepted. The trial version of the software has been converted into the professional version. You can now enjoy all the benefits of Express Scribe Transcription Software without any restrictions.
 
## Step 3: Back up your software folder
 
After you have registered the program, it is recommended that you back up your software folder because the registration code is locked to your install. This means that if you need to reinstall the software or move it to another computer, you will need to use the same installation file that you used to register the program. Otherwise, your registration code may not work on the new version of the software.
