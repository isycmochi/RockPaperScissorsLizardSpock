# An Introduction to Practical Biochemistry by David T. Plummer: A Review
 
Practical Biochemistry is an interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of chemical processes in living organisms. The field overlaps with other areas of biology and chemistry, particularly genetics and biophysics. A good understanding of practical biochemistry is essential for students and researchers who want to explore the molecular mechanisms of life.

An Introduction to Practical Biochemistry by David T. Plummer is a classic textbook that covers the basic principles and techniques of biochemistry in a clear and concise manner. The book was first published in 1978 and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition, published in 2001, contains 332 pages and 16 chapters that cover topics such as accuracy in the laboratory, pH and buffer solutions, chromatography, electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, amino acids and proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and membranes, nucleic acids, enzymes, metabolism, oxidation and reduction, vitamins and hormones, and protein synthesis.
 
The book is designed for undergraduate students who have some background in chemistry and biology. It provides a balance between theory and practice, with numerous examples, exercises, diagrams, tables, and references. The book also includes an appendix with useful information such as molecular weights, buffer tables, enzyme assays, and standard curves. The book is written in a simple and engaging style that makes it easy to follow and comprehend.
 
An Introduction to Practical Biochemistry by David T. Plummer is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the fascinating world of biochemistry. It is available as a hardcover or paperback book from various online and offline sources.

One of the best ways to learn practical biochemistry is to perform experiments in the laboratory. Experiments can help students to apply their theoretical knowledge, develop their analytical skills, and gain hands-on experience with various techniques and instruments. There are many types of experiments that can be done in biochemistry, ranging from simple to complex, and covering different topics such as enzymes, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, metabolism, and molecular biology.
 
Some examples of biochemistry experiments that can be done in college are:
 
- **ELISA**: ELISA stands for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. It is a basic assay technique that uses antibodies and enzymes to detect and quantify specific molecules in a sample. ELISA can be used for various purposes such as diagnosing diseases, measuring hormones, detecting drugs, and identifying antigens[^1^].
- **DNA/RNA Sequencing**: DNA and RNA sequencing are methods that determine the order of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA molecule. Sequencing can reveal the genetic information of an organism, such as its genes, mutations, variations, and evolution. Sequencing can be done with different technologies, such as Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing, and nanopore sequencing[^1^].
- **Nutrition**: Nutrition is the study of how food affects the health and function of living organisms. Nutrition involves the analysis of dietary components, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and water. Nutrition also examines the metabolic pathways that convert food into energy and biomolecules. Nutrition experiments can involve measuring blood glucose levels, determining caloric intake and expenditure, testing for vitamin deficiencies, and evaluating food quality[^1^].
- **Gel Electrophoresis**: Gel electrophoresis is a technique that separates molecules based on their size and charge. Gel electrophoresis can be used to analyze proteins, DNA, RNA, or other biomolecules. Gel electrophoresis involves applying an electric field across a gel matrix that contains the molecules of interest. The molecules will migrate through the gel at different rates depending on their size and charge. The resulting bands can be visualized with stains or labels[^2^].
- **Antibodies and Antigens**: Antibodies are proteins that bind to specific molecules called antigens. Antibodies are produced by the immune system to fight against foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or toxins. Antigens are any molecules that can trigger an immune response by binding to antibodies. Antigens can be found on the surface of pathogens or cells, or in soluble forms such as proteins or polysaccharides. Antibodies and antigens can be studied by various methods such as immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting[^2^].
- **Blotting Methods**: Blotting methods are techniques that transfer molecules from a gel to a membrane for detection and analysis. Blotting methods can be used to study proteins or nucleic acids after gel electrophoresis. The most common blotting methods are western blotting for proteins and southern blotting or northern blotting for DNA or RNA respectively. Blotting methods involve transferring the molecules from the gel to a membrane by capillary action or electric current. The membrane is then probed with specific antibodies or probes that bind to the target molecules. The bound antibodies or probes can be detected by colorimetric, chemiluminescent, or fluorescent methods[^2^].
- **Polymerase Chain Reaction**: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that amplifies a specific region of DNA from a small amount of template. PCR can be used for various applications such as cloning, gene expression analysis, genotyping, mutation detection, forensic analysis, and diagnosis of diseases. PCR involves repeated cycles of denaturation (separating the DNA strands), annealing (binding of primers to the target region), and extension (synthesis of new DNA strands by a polymerase enzyme). The result is an exponential increase in the number of copies of the target region[^3^].
