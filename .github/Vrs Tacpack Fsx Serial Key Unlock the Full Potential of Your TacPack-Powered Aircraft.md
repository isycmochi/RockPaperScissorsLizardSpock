## How to Use VRS TacPack in FSX
 
Once you have installed and activated VRS TacPack and loaded a compatible aircraft, you can access the various combat systems and functions using the keyboard, mouse, or joystick. You can also use the virtual cockpit or the 2D panels to interact with the systems. The exact controls and procedures may vary depending on the aircraft model and configuration, but here are some general guidelines:
 
- To arm or disarm your weapons, press SHIFT + W. You will see a window with your weapon stations and loadout. You can select or deselect the weapons you want to use by clicking on them or using the arrow keys and ENTER. You can also change the weapon type and quantity by clicking on the drop-down menus or using the +/- keys. To close the window, press SHIFT + W again.
- To cycle through your weapons, press W. You will see a HUD message with your current weapon and its status. You can also see your weapon selection on the UFCD (Up Front Control Display) or on the 2D panel.
- To fire your weapons, press SPACEBAR. Depending on the weapon type, you may need to lock on a target first using your radar or other sensors. You will hear a tone and see a cue on the HUD when you have a valid lock. You can also use the trigger on your joystick if you have one.
- To use your radar, press SHIFT + R. You will see a window with your radar display and controls. You can change the radar mode, range, scan angle, elevation, and other parameters by clicking on the buttons or using the keyboard shortcuts. You can also use the UFC (Up Front Controller) or the 2D panel to control the radar.
- To use your RWR (Radar Warning Receiver), press SHIFT + E. You will see a window with your RWR display and controls. You can change the RWR mode, volume, brightness, and other parameters by clicking on the buttons or using the keyboard shortcuts. You can also use the EWCP (Electronic Warfare Control Panel) or the 2D panel to control the RWR.
- To use your countermeasures, press D for chaff and C for flares. You will see a HUD message with your countermeasure type and quantity. You can also use the DISP button on your joystick if you have one.
