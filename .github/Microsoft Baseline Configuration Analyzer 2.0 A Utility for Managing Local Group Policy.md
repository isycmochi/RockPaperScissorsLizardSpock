## Installing MBCA 2.0
 
Before you install MBCA 2.0, make sure that your system meets the following requirements:
 
- Windows PowerShell version 2.0 or later
- Microsoft .NET Framework version 2.0 or later
- Windows Management Framework Core package

You can download MBCA 2.0 from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16475). After you download the setup file, run it as an administrator and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
 
## Using MBCA 2.0
 
To use MBCA 2.0, you need to download and install the appropriate baseline for your product. A baseline is a collection of best practices that define the recommended configuration settings for a specific product or scenario. You can find the available baselines for various Microsoft products on the [Security baselines guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-security-configuration-framework/windows-security-baselines).
 
After you install a baseline, you can run MBCA 2.0 from the Start menu or from the command line. You can specify the target computer and the baseline that you want to use for the analysis. You can also provide credentials if you want to run the analysis on a remote computer.
 
MBCA 2.0 will scan the target computer and compare its configuration settings with the baseline. It will generate a report that shows the compliance status of each setting, along with a score and a severity level. The report will also provide detailed information about each setting, such as its description, value, source, and impact. You can view the report in HTML format or export it to XML format.
