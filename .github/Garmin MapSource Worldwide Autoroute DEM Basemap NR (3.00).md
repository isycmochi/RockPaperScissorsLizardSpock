Garmin MapSource Worldwide Autoroute DEM Basemap NR (3.00) is a digital map that provides detailed road and terrain information for most countries in the world. DEM stands for Digital Elevation Model, which means that the map shows the elevation and shape of the land surface. NR stands for Non-Routable, which means that the map does not support turn-by-turn navigation or routing functions.
 
The map can be used with Garmin devices that support MapSource software, such as handheld GPS units, outdoor watches, and some automotive models. The map can also be viewed on a PC using MapSource or BaseCamp applications. The map can be useful for planning trips, exploring new areas, or finding points of interest.

To use the map, you need to download it from a reliable source and install it on your PC. Then you can transfer it to your Garmin device using a USB cable or a memory card. You can also customize the map by adding waypoints, tracks, routes, or geocaches using MapSource or BaseCamp.
 
The map has a file size of about 100 MB and covers most regions of the world except Antarctica. The map has a resolution of 90 meters per pixel and shows major roads, highways, cities, towns, rivers, lakes, coastlines, and borders. The map also shows shaded relief and contour lines to indicate the elevation and slope of the terrain.
 
Garmin MapSource Worldwide Autoroute DEM Basemap NR (3.00) is a useful tool for travelers, adventurers, and explorers who want to see the world in detail. However, it is not a substitute for a full-featured navigational map that supports routing and guidance functions. For more information about the map and how to use it, you can refer to the following sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].
  
One of the benefits of using DEM maps is that they can help to correct the distortions and errors caused by terrain variations on remotely sensed imagery. For example, DEMs can be used to adjust the pixel values of satellite images to account for the effects of slope, aspect, and elevation on the reflectance and illumination of the surface. This can improve the accuracy and quality of image classification and analysis.[^1^]

Another benefit of using DEM maps is that they can enable the generation of other types of maps that provide useful information for various applications. For example, DEMs can be used to create contour lines that show the elevation changes along a line on a map. Contour lines can help to visualize the shape and relief of the terrain and identify features such as hills, valleys, ridges, and depressions. Contour lines can also be used to measure distances, slopes, and gradients on a map.[^4^]
 
A third benefit of using DEM maps is that they can support various types of spatial analysis that depend on elevation data. For example, DEMs can be used to calculate slope, aspect, curvature, hillshade, viewshed, watershed, flow direction, flow accumulation, and stream network of a terrain. These types of analysis can help to understand the physical characteristics and processes of a landscape and support decision making in areas such as hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, geology, and land use planning.[^5^]
