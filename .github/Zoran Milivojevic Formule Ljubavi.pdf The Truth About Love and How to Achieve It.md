Formule Ljubavi (Formulas of Love) is a book by Zoran Milivojevic, a Serbian psychiatrist and psychotherapist who specializes in transactional analysis. The book is based on his clinical experience with patients who suffer from various problems related to love and relationships. The author exposes thirty common misconceptions and false beliefs about love, such as "love is the meaning of life", "in true love there are no conflicts or anger", "in true love sex is fantastic", "true love is unconditional", "true love is pain", "one can only love one person", etc. He shows how these beliefs lead to distorted patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving, and to typical problems such as love unhappiness and suffering. He also offers ways to overcome these misconceptions and to develop a more realistic and healthy view of love.
 
The book is written in a clear and accessible style, with many examples and anecdotes from the author's practice. It is aimed at a general audience who values love as a high life value and who wants to invest in their love future. It can also be useful for psychotherapists and students of psychotherapy who want to learn more about the author's system of working with love-related issues. The book includes a test at the end (separate for women and men) that indicates the beliefs that exist in one's representations of love, and the author directs the reader to the parts of the book that can help them to question their beliefs.

Transactional analysis is a branch of psychotherapy that was founded by Eric Berne in the 1950s. It is based on the assumption that human behavior is determined by three ego states: parent, adult and child. These ego states are not related to age, but to psychological functions. The parent ego state contains the norms and values that we have learned from our parents and other authority figures. The adult ego state contains the rational and objective part of our personality that deals with reality. The child ego state contains the emotional and creative part of our personality that expresses our needs and desires. Transactional analysis aims to help people understand their ego states and how they communicate with others through transactions. Transactions are exchanges of verbal and non-verbal messages between two or more people. By analyzing these transactions, one can identify the patterns of communication that lead to harmony or conflict, satisfaction or frustration, intimacy or distance.
 
Formule Ljubavi applies the principles and concepts of transactional analysis to the domain of love and relationships. The author explains how our beliefs about love are formed in our childhood, based on the messages that we receive from our parents and other significant people. He also shows how these beliefs influence our choice of partners, our expectations and demands from them, our reactions to their behavior, and our ability to cope with difficulties and challenges. He argues that many of our beliefs about love are unrealistic and irrational, and that they prevent us from achieving happiness and fulfillment in our relationships. He suggests that we need to revise these beliefs and adopt more realistic and healthy ones, such as "love is not enough", "love is not a feeling but a decision", "love is not a state but a process", "love is not a gift but a skill", etc. He also provides practical tools and techniques for improving communication, resolving conflicts, enhancing intimacy, expressing emotions, developing trust, and maintaining passion in our relationships.
