If you are a fan of flight simulation games, you might have heard of FSDreamTeam GSX, a popular add-on that enhances the ground services experience in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. GSX simulates several operations on the ground, such as marshalling, catering, boarding and deboarding of passengers and baggage, stairs, refueling vehicles, pushback with realistic behavior, follow-me cars, docking system and more. All these features are available at any airport, both default and third-party, and use native FSX animations and believable human characters.
 
GSX also supports many different types of vehicles and liveries, depending on the airplane and the geographical location. You can customize your vehicles using DirectX 11 (P3D4.4+ only) and enjoy PBR textures and new models. GSX also integrates with many popular third-party airplanes, such as PMDG 737NGX, 747 and MD11, Aerosoft and Wilco Airbus, CS767, QW757, FS Labs A320 and many others. You can interact with these complex airplanes using the Direct Airplane Interfaceâ¢, which allows you to control the doors, ground equipment and other features.

One of the most impressive features of GSX is the animated passengers. GSX displays passengers, crew and pilots boarding and deboarding the airplane, regardless if the parking has a jetway or a bus. The passengers have individual walking motions, with randomized gestures and variations, for a more natural look. You can also customize the number of passengers using SimBrief integration, which will set the number according to your last dispatch.
 
Another feature that sets GSX apart from other ground services add-ons is the pushback service. GSX adds a new kind of highly realistic pushback service, supporting vehicles with a towbar, with fully animated crew and a bypass pin simulation. The pushback works automatically, reading the airport files to place your plane exactly on the line, requiring only to choose an initial left or right direction. You can also customize the pushback procedure using the QuickEdit feature, which will automatically save it for future use.
 
GSX also supports dedicated loaders for ULD containers and pallets, which are used for cargo loading and unloading. GSX uses animated characters, made with custom motion capture sessions, to pick up bags using a highly detailed vehicle with an animated conveyor belt. GSX can support two baggage loaders operating simultaneously, compared to the default system. GSX also supports different types of cargo airplanes, such as Boeing 747-8F and 777F.
