Anonymous DoSer is a Windows program that can be used to carry out network attacks. It allows you to send requests to multiple servers at the same time. The software does not have a graphical user interface and runs only via the command line mode[^6^].
 
Network attacks are a mass distribution of requests to a specific server in order to overload and disable it. In such cases, users will not be able access the information or functionality of these resources. In order to increase the effectiveness of the attack, it is recommended to send data packets from several computers at the same time[^6^].

Anonymous DoSer is one of the many tools that are included in a bundle of DDoS tools published by the hacktivist group Anonymous in 2016. The bundle contains 20 tools that offer different types of attacks, such as HTTP, TCP, UDP and ICMP floods. Some tools also provide some evasions, such as support for sending requests with different user agent and referer headers[^6^].
 
Anonymous DoSer is a Layer 7 flooder that supports randomization of URL, User-Agent, and the Content-Length values in order to bypass hard-coded attack signatures[^6^]. It also allows the attacker to specify the duration of the network attack[^1^].
 
Please note, this utility was developed primarily for educational purposes, as well as for auditing the security level of the network resources. Using it for malicious purposes may be illegal and unethical[^1^].

## How to Protect Your Server from Anonymous DoSer
 
Anonymous DoSer is a tool that can be used to perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on specified servers. A DoS attack is an attempt to make a server or a network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a type of DoS attack that uses a large number of compromised devices, such as computers or smartphones, to launch a coordinated attack on a target server[^2^].
 
DoS and DDoS attacks can cause serious damage to the availability, performance and security of your server. They can disrupt your online services, consume your bandwidth and resources, and expose your server to other attacks. Therefore, it is important to take preventive measures to protect your server from Anonymous DoSer and other similar tools.
 
Some of the common ways to protect your server from DoS and DDoS attacks are[^3^]:
 
- Use a firewall or a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic and block unwanted requests. You can also configure your firewall or WAF to limit the rate of requests per IP address or per source.
- Use a load balancer or a reverse proxy to distribute the incoming traffic among multiple servers or instances. This can help reduce the impact of a single server being overloaded by an attack.
- Use a content delivery network (CDN) or a cloud service provider (CSP) to cache your static content and serve it from multiple locations. This can help reduce the load on your origin server and improve your website performance.
- Use an anti-DDoS service or a DDoS mitigation service to detect and filter out DDoS traffic before it reaches your server. Some examples of such services are Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Shield, Google Cloud Armor, etc.
- Monitor your server performance and traffic patterns regularly and set up alerts for any anomalies or spikes. You can also use tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Netstat, etc. to analyze your network traffic and identify the source and type of the attack.
- Update your server software and security patches regularly and follow the best practices for securing your server configuration and access. You can also use tools like SSL/TLS, SSH, VPN, etc. to encrypt your data and protect your communication.

By following these steps, you can improve your server resilience and reduce the risk of being affected by Anonymous DoSer and other DoS and DDoS tools.
