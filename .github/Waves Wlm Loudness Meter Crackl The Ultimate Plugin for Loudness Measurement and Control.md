Waves Wlm Loudness Meter Crackl features a user-friendly interface that displays various parameters and meters, such as:
 
- Loudness Range (LRA) - the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of your audio.
- Short Term (ST) - the average loudness of your audio over a short period of time (3 seconds).
- Momentary (MOM) - the peak loudness of your audio over a very short period of time (0.4 seconds).
- True Peak (TP) - the maximum level of your audio after oversampling, which can reveal clipping and distortion that are not visible in the normal peak meter.
- Integrated (I) - the average loudness of your audio over the entire duration of your project.
- Target - the desired loudness level that you want to achieve for your audio according to the chosen standard or preset.

Waves Wlm Loudness Meter Crackl also allows you to adjust the gain of your audio using the Trim knob or the Auto Trim function, which automatically matches your audio to the target level. You can also use the True Peak Limiter to prevent clipping and distortion caused by inter-sample peaks.
