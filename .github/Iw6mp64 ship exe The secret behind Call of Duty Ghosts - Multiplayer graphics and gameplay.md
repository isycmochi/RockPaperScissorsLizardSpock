Iw6mp64\_ship.exe is an executable file that is part of the Call of Duty: Ghosts - Multiplayer program developed by Infinity Ward - Sledgehammer Games[^1^]. The .exe extension of a file name indicates an executable file. In some cases, executable files can damage your computer. Therefore, you should check the location and size of the file before deleting it. The file should be located in C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Ghosts and be about 1.99 MB in size[^1^]. If you find a suspicious file with a different location or size, it may be a virus or malware that you should remove.
 
The error message may be caused by various factors, such as corrupted or missing files, outdated or incompatible drivers, incorrect registry entries, or malware infection. Here are some steps that you can try to fix the error:
 
1. Verify the integrity of game files. This can help you repair any corrupted or missing files that may cause the error. To do this, open Steam and go to Library. Right-click on Call of Duty: Ghosts - Multiplayer and select Properties. Go to Local Files tab and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files. Wait for the process to complete and then restart your computer.
2. Update your drivers. Outdated or incompatible drivers can also cause the error. You should update your graphics card, sound card, and chipset drivers to the latest versions. You can use a driver updater tool or manually download and install the drivers from the official websites of your device manufacturers.
3. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. This is a software component that is required for running some applications that use Visual C++ programming language. The error may occur if you don't have this package installed or if it is corrupted. You can download and install the package from Microsoft's website[^2^]. Make sure you choose the correct version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
4. Scan your computer for malware. Malware infection can also cause the error by modifying or deleting system files. You should use a reliable antivirus program to scan your computer and remove any malware threats. You can also use a malware removal tool or perform a system restore to undo any changes made by malware.
