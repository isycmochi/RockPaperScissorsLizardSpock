# How to Reset Epson Waste Ink Counters with WIC Reset Utility
 
If you have an Epson printer that shows an error message like "The printer's ink pads are at the end of their service life" or "A printer's ink pad is at the end of its service life. Please contact Epson Support", you may need to reset the waste ink counter. This is a feature that prevents the printer from overflowing the ink pads and causing damage or ink leakage. The waste ink counter keeps track of how much ink is used for cleaning and maintenance, and when it reaches a certain limit, it stops the printer from working.

WIC Reset Utility is a useful tool that can help you extend the life of your Epson printer and save money on ink pads replacement. However, you should also be aware of some limitations and risks of using it. For example:

- WIC Reset Utility only works with Epson printers that have a built-in waste ink counter. It does not work with other brands or models.
- WIC Reset Utility does not physically clean or replace the ink pads. It only resets the counter that monitors them. Therefore, you should periodically check the condition of the ink pads and replace them if necessary, or use an external waste ink tank to collect the excess ink.
- WIC Reset Utility may not be compatible with some firmware versions or updates of your printer. If you update your printer firmware, you may lose the ability to use WIC Reset Utility or other similar tools.
- WIC Reset Utility may void your printer warranty or violate some terms and conditions of Epson. Use it at your own risk and responsibility.
